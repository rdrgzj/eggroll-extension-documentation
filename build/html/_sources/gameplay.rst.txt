Gameplay Module
====================

This module defines the :class:`Game` class, which manages the gameplay loop, level progression, player input, and game state display.

The :class:`Game` class handles the entire gameplay process, including:

- Initializing the game with a specified level file.
- Managing player input and validating move directions.
- Displaying the game state, including the grid, score, and remaining moves.
- Handling special inputs like restarting the game or returning to the main menu.
- Calculating the player's score based on eggs and nests collected.
- Transitioning between levels and managing end-of-level state.
