Level Manager Module
======================

This module defines the `LevelManager` class which handles the functionality related to managing game levels.
It includes the ability to load level data from files, and determine the next level in a sequence.

This assumes level files are structured with the number of rows, total moves, and a grid representation of the level.
The level files must also be in '.in' format.
