Level Manager Module
====================

This module defines the `LevelManager` class, which handles 
functionality related to managing game levels. It includes 
the ability to load level data from files and determine 
the next level in a sequence.

Level files are expected to be structured with the number 
of rows, total moves, and a grid representation of the level. 
Files must also be in `.in` format.
