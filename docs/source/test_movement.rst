Movement Test
====================

Includes unit tests for methods within the 
`MovementManager` class from the movement module. These 
tests validate the behavior of movement logic such as 
transforming cells, checking egg coordinates, and handling 
movement directions, ensuring the system operates correctly 
under different grid conditions.
